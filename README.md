# ML Ops
==============================

An app where you could simulate models lifecycle. The use case consist in train models for predict the flight cancelation.
We would face unbalanced data set, missing data, and feature engineering challenges. In the model training we would use 
k-fold for a robust trainning process.

The project would contain a main python app where you will excecute the main accions like adding more data, train models, view metrics, etc. 
And custom functions for data processing and model trainning.
